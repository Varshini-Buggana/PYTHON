# Variables 
A Variable is a name given to a memory location in a program.
It holds a value.
In Python, variables are created when you assign a value to it.
"=" is known as assignment operator. It is used to assign a value to variable.
Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, and can even change type after they have been set.
Python is dynamically typed, so no need to declare types explicitly. (data types - we discuss it later)

name = "Varshini"
age = 20
height = 5.1

Rules for Variables
- Variable names must start with a letter or underscore (_) and can contain letters, digits, and underscores. 
- variables can contain digits but the variable can't start with digit.
- No special characters like #, &, @ etc.. are not allowed.
- variables should be short, simple, meaningful for better understanding.

Let's practice

1) name = "Python"
   price = 99.99
   print(name)
   print(price)
   Output:- 
     Python
     99.99

2) name = "Varshini"
   age = 20
   print("My name is",name)
   print("I am",age,"years old")
   Output:-
     My name is Varshini
     I am 20 years old

# type function

3) name = "Varshini"
   age = 20
   height = 5.1
   print(type(name))
   print(type(age))
   print(type(height))
   Output:- 
     <class 'str'>
     <class 'int'>
     <class 'float'>              
# float means decimal values
# int, float, string are known as DataTypes.

4) a = 2
   b = 5
   sum = a + b
   print(sum)
   Output:-
      7


# Indentation

Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.
Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important.
Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.
example:-
if 5 > 2:
      print("Five is greater than two!")

Python will give you an error if you skip the indentation:
The number of spaces is up to you as a programmer, the most common use is four, but it has to be at least one.
You have to use the same number of spaces in the same block of code, otherwise Python will give you an error
