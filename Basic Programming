# First Simple Basic Python Program - Printing Hello World

# The Hello, World! program is the most basic program used to introduce a programming language.
# In Python, we can print "Hello, World!" using the print() function:

                print("Hello World!!")

# Explanation:
# print() is a built-in function in Python that displays the specified message on the screen.

# The text "Hello, World!" is enclosed in double quotes (" "), making it a string. Strings can also be enclosed in single quotes (' ').

# When we run the program, Python executes the print() function and displays:

                   Hello World

# Why is this important?
# This program helps beginners understand how Python executes code.
# It introduces the concept of functions (print()), strings ("Hello, World!"), and syntax in Python.
# It ensures that the Python environment is correctly set up.
