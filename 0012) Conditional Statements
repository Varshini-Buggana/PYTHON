# conditional Statements
In our daily life there are many conditions like 
- For licence, age must be greater than 18
- For passing the exams, marks must be greater than 35
- For voting right, age must be greater than 18 ............
To write these coditions in coding we use if, else ....

1) if-elif-else
    Syntax:- 
    if(condition 1):
        Statement 1
    elif(condition 2)            # elif is the expanded form of else and if
        Statement 2
    else:
        Statement 3

    Program:-
    age = 21
    if(age >= 18):
        print("Eligible")
    else:
        print("Not eligible")

    Output:-
    Eligible
