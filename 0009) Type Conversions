# Type Conversions
Convert one data type into other data type

Two types :- 
1) Type Conversion - automatic conversion (By interpreter)
2) Type Casting    - done manually (By User)

Let's try this

1) a = 2
   b = 3.2
   sum = a + b             # 2.0 + 3.2 = 5.2  (int convert to float because float is superior)
   print(sum) 
   Output:-   
      5.2


2) a = 1
   b = "2"
   sum = a + b
   print(sum)
   Output:-
      TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'

  Note:- string to int is not possible by interpreter we have to do it manually.
         String can not be converted into float.
         float can be converted into string. 

3) a = 1
   b = "2"
   c = int(b)
   sum = a + c
   print(sum)
   Output:- 
      3
