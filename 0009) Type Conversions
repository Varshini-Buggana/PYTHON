# Type Conversions
Convert one data type into other data type

Two types :- 
1) Type Conversion - automatic conversion (By interpreter)
2) Type Casting    - done manually (By User)

Let's try this

Type Conversion
1) a = 2
   b = 3.2
   sum = a + b             # 2.0 + 3.2 = 5.2  (int convert to float because float is superior)
   print(sum) 
   Output:-   
      5.2

Type Casting
If you want to specify the data type of a variable, this can be done with casting.
x = str(3)    # x will be '3'
y = int(3)    # y will be 3
z = float(3)  # z will be 3.0

1) a = 1
   b = "2"
   sum = a + b
   print(sum)
   Output:-
      TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'

  Note:- string to int is not possible by interpreter we have to do it manually.
         String can not be converted into float.
         float can be converted into string. 

If this program do like the following program we can't get error.
   a = 1
   b = "2"
   c = int(b)
   sum = a + c
   print(sum)
   Output:- 
      3
