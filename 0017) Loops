Loops

- Loops are used to repeat instruction.
- Loops are of 2 types:-
  (i) while Loop
  (ii) for Loop

Why to use Loops?
If you need to print "hello" 5 times, what you do?
    print("hello")
    print("hello")
    print("hello")
    print("hello")
    print("hello")

What about 100 times? what about 10,000 times? we can't do it that many times, right?
soo, here Loops are used.

While Loops:-

while is a reserved keyword.
Syntax:-
    while condition:
      # some work

checks the condition, do work, again check the condition and again do some work . It repeats again and again until the condition become false.
This is known as iterations. 
Now by using while loop how to print "hello" 10,000 times.

    count = 1
    while count <= 10000:
        print("hello")
        count += 1

In the above example "hello" will be printed 10000 times.
why we use increment(count += 1) here?
If we don't use increment then the loop will not stop . It will print 'hello'  infinite times. You can try this once

    count = 1
    while count <= 10:
        print("hello")
Output be 'hello' printed infinite times. until the memory 


Now print hello with count
    i = 1
    while i <= 5:
        print("hello", i)
        i += 1
    O/P:-
    hello 1
    hello 2
    hello 3
    hello 4
    hello 5

Print numbers from 1 to 5         |   Print numbers from 5 to 1
                                  |
      i = 1                       |       i = 5
      while i <= 5:               |       while i >= 1:
          print(i)                |            print(i)
          i += 1                  |            i -= 1
      print("Loop ended")         |       print("Loop ended")
                                  |
      O/P:-                       |       O/P:-
      1                           |       5
      2                           |       4
      3                           |       3
      4                           |       2
      5                           |       1
      Loop ended                  |       Loop ended




* Break & Continue
Break:- used to terminate the loop when encountered.
Continue:- terminates execution in the current iteration & continues execution of the loop with the next iteration.

i = 1
while i <= 5:
    print(i)
    if(i == 3):
        break
    i += 1
print("end of loop")

O/P:-
1
2
3
end of loop


i = 1
while i <= 5:
    if(i == 3):
        i += 1
        continue
    print(i)
    i += 1
print("end of loop")

O/P:-
1
2
4
5
end of loop
