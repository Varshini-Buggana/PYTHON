# Comments
 
Comments can be used to explain Python code.
Comments are used to understand the code.
Comments are not printed, they are not the part of the program code. They are placed at the end of a line. Python will ignore them.
They are helpful for better understanding of the program code, they make the code more readable.
Python has commenting capability for the purpose of in-code documentation.

They are 2 types of Comments
- Single Line Comments
- Multi Line Comments

Comments start with a #, and Python will render the rest of the line as a comment

Single Line Comments are denoted by hash 
# Single Line Comment
Multi Line Comments are denoted by triple quotes

Let's try this
1) a = 4              # a is assigned to 4
   b = 2              # b is assigned to 2
   diff = a - b       
   print(diff)        # display the difference between a and b
   Output:- 
     2

2) """ 
   Write a program

   """
   print("Varshini")
   Output:- 
     Varshini
