# Variables 
A Variable is a name given to a memory location in a program.
It holds a value.
"=" is known as assignment operator. It is used to assign a value to variable.
In Python, you donâ€™t need to declare the type of a variable explicitly; Python determines the type dynamically.
Python is dynamically typed, so no need to declare types explicitly. (data types - we discuss it later)

name = "Varshini"
age = 20
height = 5.1

Rules for Variables
- Variable names must start with a letter or underscore (_) and can contain letters, digits, and underscores. 
- variables can contain digits but the variable can't start with digit.
- No special characters like #, &, @ etc.. are not allowed.

Let's practice

1) name = "Python"
   price = 99.99
   print(name)
   print(price)
   Output:- 
     Python
     99.99

2) name = "Varshini"
   age = 20
   print("My name is",name)
   print("I am",age,"years old")
   Output:-
     My name is Varshini
     I am 20 years old
