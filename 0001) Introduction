# Introduction to Python

## What is Programming 
To interact with people we need a language. Like wise to interact with python we need a Language. (i.e. Programming language). 
Programming is a way for us to tell computers what to do. Computer is a dumb machine and it only does what we tell it to do.

## What is Python?
- Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It is widely used for web development, data science, automation, artificial intelligence, and more.
- Python is developed by Guido Van Rossum in 1991.

## Features of Python
- **Easy to Learn**: Python has a simple syntax similar to English.
- Python is free and Open source programming language
- **Interpreted Language**: No need for compilation; code runs directly.
- **Dynamically Typed**: No need to declare variable types explicitly.
- **Cross-Platform**: Runs on Windows, Mac, and Linux.
- **Large Community Support**: A vast number of libraries and frameworks available.
- **Versatile**: Used in various fields like web development, data science, AI, and automation.
- **Case-Sensitive**: Upper case and Lower case letters are treated as different

## Why to Learn Python?
- Beginner-friendly and widely used in the industry.
- Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.
- Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).
- Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.
- Has extensive libraries for different applications.
- Supports object-oriented, procedural, and functional programming.
- Used by top companies like Google, Netflix, and NASA.

## What is Python used For?
- Python is used in Data Visualization to create plots and graphical representation
- Python helps in data analysis to analyze and understand raw data for insights and trends
- It is used in AI and machine learning to simulate human behaviour and to learn from past data without hard coding
- It is used to create web applications (server side)
- It can be used to handle databases
- It is used in business and accounting to perform complex mathematical operations along with quantities and quantitative analysis.
- Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.
- Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.
- Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files


## How to Install Python
1. Download Python from the official website: [python.org](https://www.python.org/)
2. Install it on your system and check the version using:
   in command prompt:- 

   ```
   python --version 
   ```

Many PCs and Macs will have python already installed.

To check if you have python installed on a Windows PC, search in the start bar for Python or run the following on the Command Line (cmd.exe):
```
   C:\Users\Your Name>python --version
```
To check if you have python installed on a Linux or Mac, then on linux open the command line or on Mac open the Terminal and type:
```
python --version
```
If you find that you do not have Python installed on your computer, then you can download it for free from the following website: https://www.python.org/

To check the Python version of the editor, you can find it by importing the sys module:
```
   import sys
   print(sys.version)
```

# Python Quickstart

Python is an interpreted programming language, this means that as a developer you write Python (.py) files in a text editor and then put those files into the python interpreter to be executed.

The way to run a python file is like this on the command line:
```
   C:\Users\Your Name>python helloworld.py
```
Where "helloworld.py" is the name of your python file.

Let's write our first Python file, called helloworld.py, which can be done in any text editor.
```
   helloworld.py
   print("Hello, World!")
```
Simple as that. Save your file. Open your command line, navigate to the directory where you saved your file, and run:
```
   C:\Users\Your Name>python helloworld.py
```
The output should read:
Hello, World!

Congratulations, you have written and executed your first Python program.
