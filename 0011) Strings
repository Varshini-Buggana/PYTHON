# strings
string is a data type that stores a sequence of characters.
String is like a sentence

Let's try this

str1 = "This is a String"          # double quotes
str2 = 'VarshiniBuggana'           # single quote
str3 = """ This is a String """    # triple quote


Why these many kind of quotes?
If any statement consits of single or double quotes, to avoid that confusion different quotes are used.
ex:- 
Program:- 
  str = "Hello, I'm Varshini"
  print(str)
Output:-
  Hello, I'm Varshini


How to print a statement in new line ?
\n is used to print a statement in new line.
Program:-
  str1 = "This is a string. \nThis is in new line"
  print(str1)
Output:-
  This is a string.
  This is in new line

# Basic Operations
